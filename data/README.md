eHound provides clients with a suite of APIs designed to support the effective management and publication of location data across multiple channels / devices as follows.

## Data APIs:
The eHound data API provides an extract of data to which a given account has access, either because it is stored in that Account, or is part of a Group Category to which that Account has been associated.

At present it is used exclusively by BNP Paribas to provide a global summary of their GA / GN Networks.

As such access is restricted to those Accounts for which the relevant licence arrangement is in place.

This Developer Portal is focused on the Data APIs, and provides code samples and other guidance to assist developers in their implementation.

Simply use the tabs of the left hand side to access this information, and if you have any further questions simply contact us at support@ehoundplatform.com
